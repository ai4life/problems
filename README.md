## Open Problems In AGI

1. Limited Experience Problem - Many AI learning methods require huge quantities of data, but humans require few (some times as little as one) example(s) to learn a thing.
2. Control Problem - How to prevent AGI from doing something?
3. Consciousness Problem - What is the nature of consciousness, and what algorithm will allow us to reproduce it?
4. Knowledge Transfer Problem - How do we transfer learning from one task to another.
5. Ethics Problem - What ethics ought we give our AGI?
