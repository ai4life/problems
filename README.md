## Open Problems In AGI

1. Limited Experience Problem - Many AI learning methods require huge quantities of data, but humans require few (some times as little as one) example(s) to learn a thing.
2. [Control Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_control_problem) - How to prevent AGI from doing something?
3. Consciousness Problem - What is the nature of consciousness, and what algorithm will allow us to reproduce it?
4. Knowledge Transfer Problem - How do we transfer learning from one task to another.
5. Ethics Problem - What ethics ought we give our AGI?
6. [Symbol Grounding Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_grounding_problem) - How abstract symbols can be grounded in empirical experience.
7. [Catastrophic Forgetting Problem](https://deepmind.com/blog/enabling-continual-learning-in-neural-networks/) - Computer programs that learn to perform tasks also typically forget them very quickly.
